# Reading list

Every other lecture, we will **discuss two prescribed papers** (i.e. that I have either allocated or approved ahead of time). Each paper will be presented (15 minutes) by a group of two students and then discussed (10 minutes). The reading task accounts for `30% of the grade= presenting a paper [group of 2] OR writing a report [alone]`. Given the number of students, not everyone can present.
Students not presenting should prepare questions on one of the two papers.

For presentations, please indicate on the [signing sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dDQDuJbImoBO9dWjGkpDOwDiZBpd2fddcO3PZb9IQ/edit?usp=sharing) your 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice, together with your names. Preferences will be aggregated using a complex algorithm.

##### Grading (=30% of total grade)
- Individual: 
  - Presentation skill: 5%

##### Grading (=30% of total grade)
- Quality of the document: 5%
- Summary: 5%
- Critical assessment: 10%
- Suggestion: 5%
- Class participation to the discussions: 5%

### Content

The presentation and report should be structured around the following dimensions:
1. Give a **brief summary** of what the article was about:
  - What are the key (research) questions the author(s) are trying to address?
  - Does the paper’s result rely on theoretical or empirical hypothesis?
  - What are the main results?
2. **Critical assessment**:
  - If the paper is long, you can spend more time on one aspect of the results.
  - What is your opinion of the article?
  - What are the strengths and the limitations of the paper that you would like to bring forward?
3. **Possible extension**:
  - Suggest possible extension(s) of the paper. For example a way to improve the methodology, to extend data limitations, to test another mechanism, to adress a complementary research question.

## Article list and schedule

Articles will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. Each person is expected to present twice. Please add your name to the table below (you can [edit this README](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) directly on GitHub) as soon as you have chosen.
